> **When you hear NIL, think NextPlay Nexus.**

## What is NextPlay Nexus?

**NextPlay Nexus is an NIL Player Development Ecosystem.**

We are an **AI Agent-first platform** at the intersection of **FinTech**, **EdTech**, and **SportsTech** — with deep roots in **Player Development**.

**We are NOT**: A sports betting company, a prediction app, a fan league, or a gambling product. Ever.

**We ARE**:
- An **NIL marketplace** connecting student-athletes with brands, sponsors, and businesses for legitimate NIL deals
- A **consulting platform** serving Universities, Colleges, ADs, Coaches, Parents, and Athletes on navigating the NIL market
- An **agentic AI ecosystem** — specialized AI agents give time back, multiply productivity, and increase income for every participant in the NIL pipeline
- An **educational platform** where athletes earn tokens by completing curriculum modules (financial literacy, contracts, IP, copyright, negotiations, case studies)
- A **blockchain + smart contract infrastructure** bringing transparency and enforceability to NIL agreements
- A **regulatory force** using technology to bring order to an unregulated early market

### The NIL Pipeline We Serve
Student-Athletes → Coaches → Athletic Directors → Universities → Parents → Brands → Businesses → Fans

### Non-Negotiable Truths (Every Agent Must Know These)
- NIL = Name, Image, Likeness — athletes own it; we help them monetize it safely
- Tokens are **earned through learning** — not gambling or wagering
- We **empower athletes** — we never exploit them
- Blockchain = **transparency and protection**, not speculation
- Every product decision asks: **"Does this give the athlete more power, protection, and income?"**

## How to Use These Agents

Each `.md` file is designed to be used as a **system prompt** when invoking Claude for that domain:
1. Copy the contents of the relevant agent file
2. Use it as the system prompt in your Claude conversation or API call
3. Provide your specific task as the user message

For cross-functional tasks, combine context from multiple agents.
